A few years later in 4th grade he performed his first improv scene, miming a pet turtle pooping in his hands. Not much had changed for Nick. As an artist, he works as a director, writer, and actor of scripted and unscripted work. Most of the rest of his time is spent typing Python and SQL as he pursues a goal of working in sports data science and analytics. He takes great joy in directing this show and working with this team and there's absolutely no way he couldn't have done it without the love of his life, Nako. He hopes your Christmas is perfectly ruined üëºüéÑ‚ú®",

Improv has been a major part of his life ever since. In college he joined and then directed Without an Box, the Claremont College's improv and experimental theater group. After moving to Seattle, he joined a collective of folks just hanging out and improvising, from which came his first improv group: Sisters of Sal. Soon after, he joined the ranks of Jet City Improv where he spent the majority of his improv career. There he created such shows as Shades of Gray, Unspeakable Horrors, and Funbucket. He joined the cast of Uncle Mike Ruins Christmas the very first year and has been in love with it ever since, missing a couple years in the middle. This show is always the highlight of his year, doing the funniest, stupidest stuff with the funniest, most wonderful people and he wouldn't trade it for anything.",
